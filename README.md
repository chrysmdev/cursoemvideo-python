# Python Course

 Python course material from [Curso em VÃ­deo](https://www.cursoemvideo.com)!

 I took this course at the end of 2023, it was my second contact with Python, the first contact was at the Universidade Federal de Sergipe (UFS).

 In this repository there is all the content of the python classes, where I made some summaries of the classes and all the activities of the course, which was divided into three parts called "Mundo" (there is no separation of these parts in the repository).
 
 Some activities have their own folders according to how the teacher planned them to be carried out using modularization
