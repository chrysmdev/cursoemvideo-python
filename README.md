# Python Course

Python course material from [Curso em VÃ­deo](https://www.cursoemvideo.com)!

I took this course at the end of 2023. It was my second experience with Python; my first was at the Universidade Federal de Sergipe (UFS).

This repository contains all the content from the Python classes, including summaries and all the course activities. The course was divided into three parts called "Mundo" (these parts are not separated in the repository).

Some activities have their own folders, organized according to the way the instructor planned them, using modularization.
